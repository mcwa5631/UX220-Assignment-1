## Research

The article "Student perspectives on competency based portolios" contrasts my goals set surrounding my family, career, friends, and recreational goals. 
This article discusses the importance of using a portfolio to track students progress and tasks they have completed as well as how students feel when asking for 
tangible feedback that allows them to properly use a portfolio. This article contrasts my own goals set because they lack the ability to be measured and revised when 
I have difficulty achieving them. Without anyone or anyway to get feedback on my goals I will struggle much more to achieve them. 

One of the main findings in this research was that in order for portfolios to be effective students need to have personalized captions and must take their own perspectives 
into account. My goals lack this personalization, although they are my goals, they lack specifics to provide my own perspective and planning on them just like achievements in a 
portfolio. Flexibility of a portfolio in order to achieve my goals is also key. This way a portfolio, acting as a plan to achieve my goals, is better tailored for me and allows me 
to reach them how I would like.
